# Snake Game

## Introduction

A simple Snake game developed in C++. I used curses library to display the maze and get arrow key inputs for moving the snake.

## How to build

This project uses CMake to build. Create a build directory using `mkdir build` and then run `cmake ..` inside that directory. This will generate a makefile. Simply run `make` to create an executable and then run the game by `make`.
